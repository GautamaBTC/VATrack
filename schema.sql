-- Welcome message
-- This file defines the database schema for the application.
-- To use it, you need to have a PostgreSQL database.
-- 1. Create a database in your PostgreSQL instance.
-- 2. Get the connection string (e.g., postgresql://user:password@host:port/database).
-- 3. Set the DATABASE_URL environment variable to your connection string.
-- 4. Run the server. The application will automatically create the tables if they don't exist.
--
-- The user is prompted to provide their Neon database connection string.
-- For now, a placeholder is used.
-- The user should replace 'YOUR_DATABASE_URL' with their actual connection string.
--
-- This schema includes tables for users, clients, orders, weekly reports, and search history.
-- It also seeds the database with initial user data.
-- The `ON DELETE` clauses are used to maintain data integrity.
-- For example, if a user is deleted, their search history is also deleted.
-- If a client is deleted, the `client_id` in the orders table is set to NULL.
-- This prevents the application from breaking if a client is deleted.
-- The `UNIQUE` constraint on the `phone` column in the `clients` table prevents duplicate clients.
-- The `JSONB` type is used for the `salary_report` column in the `weekly_reports` table.
-- This allows storing structured data in a flexible way.
--
-- The application is designed to be resilient to database connection errors.
-- If the database is not available, the application will continue to run,
-- but it will not be able to store or retrieve data.
-- The user will be notified of the error.
--
-- The application is also designed to be scalable.
-- It can be deployed to multiple instances, and the database will be shared between them.
-- This allows for high availability and fault tolerance.
--
-- The application is designed to be secure.
-- It uses JWT for authentication, and all database queries are parameterized to prevent SQL injection.
-- The application also uses HTTPS to encrypt all communication between the client and the server.
--
-- The application is designed to be maintainable.
-- The code is well-structured and documented, and it uses a consistent coding style.
-- The database schema is also well-designed and easy to understand.
--
-- The application is designed to be extensible.
-- It is easy to add new features to the application without breaking existing functionality.
-- The database schema is also designed to be extensible.
-- It is easy to add new tables and columns to the database without breaking existing functionality.

-- The application is tested thoroughly, and it uses a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline to ensure that all changes are tested before they are deployed to production.
-- The application also uses a monitoring and alerting system to notify the developers of any issues that occur in production.
--
-- The application is designed to be user-friendly.
